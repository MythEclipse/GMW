/**
 * Per-file Postgres schema isolation.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: eleven files in this directory TRUNCATE the same tables in
 * `beforeAll`/`beforeEach`. Under bun they ran sequentially, so they were safe by
 * accident of the runner. Vitest parallelises by default, and the files then
 * wipe each other's rows mid-run — `worker.test.ts` passes 31/31 alone and fails
 * in the full suite for exactly that reason. The fix chosen at the time was
 * `fileParallelism: false` in vitest.config.ts, which serialises the whole suite
 * and hides the coupling rather than removing it.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES: every file gets its own schema, named from the file plus a
 * random suffix, with `search_path` pinned to it on the pool. A `TRUNCATE
 * messages` inside that file can only see that file's tables. Two files may then
 * run concurrently without observing each other.
 *
 * WHY A SCHEMA AND NOT A TRANSACTION: the tests need real commits and a real
 * worker loop across many round trips; a rolled-back transaction would hide all
 * of it. Schemas are also cheap — CREATE SCHEMA is a catalogue entry, no table
 * copying.
 *
 * WHY `CREATE TABLE ... LIKE public.<t>`: the production schema, including its
 * CHECK constraints and its functions, lives in `public`. Each file gets
 * structurally identical tables without duplicating the DDL, so a schema change
 * in migrations/ does not silently desynchronise the tests.
 *
 * NOT USED BY ANY FILE YET: this helper is the mechanism. Adopting it across the
 * eleven files is a separate, per-file change, verified one file at a time. Each
 * adoption is behaviour-preserving — the schema name and the unqualified table
 * names in the SQL stay exactly as they are.

 * The tables the gateway tests actually read or write in SQL.

 * four, and the TRUNCATE lists in the files agree —
 *
 *   TRUNCATE messages, verdicts, analysis_attempts, attachments
 *
 * An earlier version of this list carried ten names, six of them copied from a
 * COMMENT in skipped-channel.test.ts that enumerates the migration's tables
 * rather than anything the tests touch. Two of those six do not even exist: the
 * table is `message_reactions`, not `reactions`. Under GMW_REQUIRE_TEST_DB=1
 * that turned a working suite into 10 failing files with
 * `relation "public.reactions" does not exist` — the strict mode working
 * correctly on a list that was wrong.
 *
 * Adding a table here is only necessary when a test starts USING it. A name
 * that does not exist in `public` fails the whole file, deliberately: a typo in
 * this list must not look like a passing suite.

/**

 * IT WARNS BEFORE DOING SO. A silent skip is indistinguishable from a pass: if
 * the tables this file mirrors are missing, every one of its assertions quietly
 * stops running and the suite stays green while testing nothing. That is not
 * hypothetical — CI provisions a stock `postgres:18` with no schema applied, so
 * `CREATE TABLE ... LIKE public.<table>` fails there until a migration step is
 * added to the workflow. Measured against an empty database: 21 files skip, and
 * the suite reports success.
 *
 * So this ALSO FAILS THE RUN when it is skipped in CI, where a database is
 * supposed to be available. A skip is legitimate on a laptop with no Postgres;
 * it is a misconfigured pipeline everywhere else. Set
 * `GMW_REQUIRE_TEST_DB=1` (the CI workflow does) to turn the warning into a
 * thrown error, which fails the suite loudly instead of reporting a green run
 * that tested nothing.
