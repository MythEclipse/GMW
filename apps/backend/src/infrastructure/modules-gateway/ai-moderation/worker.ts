/**
 * v2 moderation worker — the durable half of moderation.
 *
 * ## What replaced what
 *
 * v1 kept the work queue as in-process state: a `Map` of pending
 * conversations, a scheduler interval per lane, cooldown timestamps, a
 * conversation-level lock, and a global circuit-breaker counter. None of that
 * survives a restart, which is the mechanism behind every "message got stuck"
 * report: the row is committed to Postgres as `processing`, and the process
 * that owned the timer is gone.
 *
 * v2 keeps nothing. The queue IS the `ai_status` column. A worker asks the
 * database for claimable work, holds a time-boxed lease while it processes,
 * and the database hands the work to someone else if the lease lapses. A
 * worker can be killed at any instant with no lost work and no duplicated
 * verdict, because correctness is enforced by `claim_messages` and the
 * deferred trigger, not by this file's control flow.
 *
 * ## Module-local state, deliberately
 *
 * Only two things live here: the worker identity (a random id, so a restarted
 * process does not inherit a dead worker's claims) and the poll loop itself.
 * Neither affects correctness.
