/**
 * Read `messages.metadata -> 'channel' ->> 'channelName'`.
 *
 * Prisma's query builder has no `->>` path expression, so the JSON traversal
 * these SQL fragments used to perform is done in JS.
 *
 * `messages.metadata` is a `text` column holding a JSON document — it is not a
 * jsonb column — so Prisma hands it back as the raw string and the parse has to
 * happen here. An object is accepted too, since `verdicts.evidence` IS jsonb and
 * callers reuse this for it. Returns `undefined` rather than throwing when the
 * value is null, unparseable, or lacks the key, matching the SQL, which yielded
 * NULL in every one of those cases.
 *
 * Shared because several repositories resolve channel names the same way: a
 * caller that wanted the id it fell back to had to re-implement the same
 * COALESCE(NULLIF(...), channel_id) shape.
