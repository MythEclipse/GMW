 * which `routeFileIgnorePattern` keeps out of the generated route tree.
 *
 * A distinct module per route gives a distinct component INSTANCE per route,
 * which is the second invariant the old `router.tsx` doc comment warned about.
 * Hoisting a page into a shared const reused across routes would make React
 * reconcile by component type, and MessagesView's local
 * guildId/channelId/search/tab state would survive navigation instead of
