/**
 * Client route for /messages — was a server component.
 *
 * Two things the server did that no SWR hook can reproduce, both reproduced
 * here in the same order:
 *
 *  1. `guildId` is derived as `guilds[0]?.id ?? defaultGuildId` and seeded into
 *     the view's `useState`. It is the root of the guild → channels → messages
 *     chain, and `useTextChannels` keys on `guildId ? … : null`, so a null
 *     guildId means the channel picker never fetches at all.
 *
 *  2. `getMessages` REQUIRES a guild or channel id. When the archive is empty
 *     (no `messages.guilds` row yet) the server skipped the call entirely
 *     rather than issuing a request the backend rejects with a
 *     ValidationError. That guard is preserved — see `EMPTY_PAGE`.

/**
 * /messages
 *
 * The page body and the route module are one file: the old Next.js
 * `src/app/(dashboard)/<feature>/page.tsx` was folded in here when that tree was
 * retired. The view it renders sits beside this file at `_components/view.tsx`,
 * which `routeFileIgnorePattern` keeps out of the generated route tree.
 *
 * A distinct module per route gives a distinct component INSTANCE per route,
 * which is the second invariant the old `router.tsx` doc comment warned about.
 * Hoisting a page into a shared const reused across routes would make React
 * reconcile by component type, and MessagesView's local
 * guildId/channelId/search/tab state would survive navigation instead of
 * resetting.
 *
 * `validateSearch` types the drill-down contract. Every stat tile on the
 * dashboard links here with `?status=` or `?verdict=`, so those keys are the
 * app's URL API — declaring them here makes a typo a compile error rather than a
 * filter that silently does nothing.
 *
 * Both values are read as `string | undefined`, NOT narrowed to an enum: the
 * allow-list check is `filterFromUrl(value, PIPELINE_STATUSES, ANY)` inside the
 * view, and it must stay there. Narrowing here would reject an unknown value
 * with a router error instead of falling back to `ANY`, which is what lets a
 * hand-edited or stale `?status=` degrade to "unfiltered" rather than erroring.
