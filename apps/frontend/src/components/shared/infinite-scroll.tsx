/**
 * Auto-loads the next page when this sentinel scrolls into view.
 *
 * WHY AN INTERSECTION OBSERVER AND NOT A SCROLL HANDLER
 *
 * The obvious version listens to `scroll` on a container and compares
 * `scrollTop + clientHeight >= scrollHeight`. That fires on every frame of a
 * trackpad gesture, forces layout on each one to read `scrollHeight`, and needs
 * the scroll container threaded in from whatever ancestor happens to scroll. An
 * IntersectionObserver is none of those: the browser does the geometry, the
 * callback fires only on an actual threshold crossing, and it watches a
 * viewport-relative rect, so it works no matter which ancestor scrolls.
 *
 * WHY `rootMargin` IS POSITIVE
 *
 * A zero-margin observer fires when the sentinel is merely *visible*, which on a
 * short page starts the next fetch before the user has finished reading — and on
 * a page shorter than the viewport it fires immediately, repeatedly, until the
 * backend runs out of rows. Loading one viewport-height early means the data is
 * usually already there when the sentinel truly reaches the bottom, so the list
 * never visibly stalls.
 *
 * WHY THE STRICT-INTERSECTION GUARD
 *
 * `isIntersecting` stays true for as long as the sentinel overlaps the
 * viewport, and `fetchNextPage()` can be in flight for that whole time. Without
 * the `cancelled` latch guarding the callback, every re-render while the
 * sentinel is on screen fires another request for the same page — the classic
 * "infinite scroll hammers the API" bug. `isFetching` covers the in-flight case;
 * the local `cancelled` ref covers the window between one fetch settling and
 * React re-rendering with the new `isFetching` value.
