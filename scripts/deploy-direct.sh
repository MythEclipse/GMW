# deploy-direct.sh — build GMW from source and install systemd units
# Replaces the Nix profile-based deployment (flake.nix / nix-env / nix copy).
#
# Layout:
#   /opt/gmw/releases/<sha>/   — full checkout at a given git sha (immutable)
#   /opt/gmw/current           — symlink to the active release
#   /opt/gmw/bin/*             — thin wrappers that cd into current and exec node
#   /etc/systemd/system/gmw-*.service
#   /etc/nginx/sites-available/gmw-proxy
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/deploy-direct.sh [branch|sha]
#
# Env:
#   REMOTE_REPO       — git remote to fetch (default: https://github.com/asepharyana/GMW.git)
#   DEPLOY_REF        — branch, tag, or sha to deploy (default: main)
#   RESET_RUNTIME_DATA— 1 (default) wipes Postgres `dcbot` + Hindsight
#                       `gmw-moderation` before the restart; 0 skips the wipe
#                       for an incident deploy that must keep its rows.
#   KEEP_RELEASES       — how many releases to keep for rollback (default 2 =
#                       the live one + one previous). Step 11 prunes the rest.

#   * step 7 chowns the whole tree to gmw so the service can read it, after

#   ENOENT: failed to symlink dependencies for package: discord-moderation-backend
#   EEXIST: failed to link binaries for package: frontend
#   Failed to install 5 packages
#
# and `--frozen-lockfile` on top of that reports "no changes" over an install
# that is missing typescript and biome, so the build would fail later at tsc.
#
# `pnpm install` here takes ~1s and `tsc` ~10s, so rebuilding from a clean
# checkout is far cheaper than making a mutated tree idempotent. The reuse
# branch above therefore only fires for a dir that was fetched but never built.

# instead of paying a private ~599M copy per deploy. 28 releases at ~610M each
# was 19G of /opt; sharing the store makes a release's marginal cost ~0.
#
# The hazard is ownership, and it is real: with `import_method=hardlink` a file
# in the release and the same file in the pnpm store are ONE inode. Step 7's
# `chown -R gmw:gmw` therefore escapes the release and flips the STORE — and
# the developer's own checkout, since prod and dev share a filesystem here —
# to `gmw`, after which their next install dies with:
#   EPERM: operation not permitted, chmod '.../node_modules/.pnpm/...'
#
# The fix is not to abandon hardlinks; it is to stop the chown from crossing
# the boundary. Step 7 now chowns ONLY files with link count 1 (the ones this
# release genuinely owns) and leaves every hardlinked inode alone, so the store
# keeps its original owner. A dedicated store under /opt also means the
# release tree and the store are one filesystem owned by one user, which is
# what makes the hardlink legal in the first place.

#     one.
#   * after the restart — so nothing is deleted while a process is still cwd'd
#     into it. `rm -rf` of a live release leaves the running service answering
#     from deleted inodes until it next restarts, which reads as healthy.
